# PROJECT RULES

When adding a visual element into the code always add all its modifiable visual settings to [settings.py](mdc:settings.py):
For example when you add a button, include a scaling variable and distance from center (x and y) in [settings.py](mdc:settings.py). When these variables change, the display should change next time the script is ran.
